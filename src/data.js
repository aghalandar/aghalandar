    title: "Closures, Mobility, Busy Parents, and Distracted Retail Investors",
    summary:
      "Using mobility statistics and weekly closure data at the county level, we find a significant negative association between school/daycare closures (and mobility for workplaces and residential locations) and the trading activities of OTC-traded firms during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The associations for closures are more pronounced for simultaneous school/daycare closures, and for smaller firms, those with lower institutional ownership, less investor recognition, and limited geographic dispersion in business activities. The adverse effect of such closures on the trading activities of OTC stocks is consistent with pandemic-induced attention distraction and increased busyness of local (essentially retail) investors with children.",

    title: "Does the Mad Money Show cause investors to go madly attentive?",
    summary:
      "We find that firm mentions/recommendations on the popular Mad Money Show significantly affect institutional and retail investor active attention, proxied by SEC EDGAR queries and posts on Stocktwits. The effects depend on recommendation directions (buy or sell) and a stockâ€™s exposure on the Show. Effects remain after controlling for other firm-specific news and moderating events (e.g., Superbowl and Olympics). The induced investor active attention subsequently affects abnormal trading volumes and short-sales activities of institutional/retail investors, and retail investor portfolios. No abnormal returns are associated with any pre-Show publicity about upcoming guest interviews. Significantly positive (negative) following-day abnormal returns for buy (sell) recommendations become significantly negative (positive) by day 20. Overall, our findings are consistent with the impact of the media and its potential influencers on the limited active attention budgets of investors, the short-term price pressure associated with noise traders, and the shorting of contrarian investors.",
